#
# ## EMPHASIS (Exercise 3 of 12)
#
# It's easy to mark text as italic, bold, combined and strikethrough. There
# are few ways to make emphasis in Markdown and each of those is readable.
#
# To get emphasis just wrap some text in single, double or triple asterisks
# (*) or underscores (_). Here are some examples:
#
#   Italics with *asterisks* and _underscores_.
#
# |> Italics with asterisks and underscores.
#
#   Bold with **asterisks** or __underscores__
#
# |> Bold with asterisks or underscores
#
#   Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.
#
# |> Combined emphasis with asterisks and underscores.
#
# Sometimes you need to draw line through the text. To get strikethrough
# wrap the text in two tildes (~) like so:
#
#   ~~Scratch this line.~~
#
# |> Scratch this line.
#
# ## THE CHALLENGE
#
# Create a new file and add a first-level heading at the top of your file.
# This heading should contain Emphasis text.
#
# Below the heading, add this text:
#
#   It's very easy to use italic, bold and combined emphasis in Markdown!

# # Nice job!
#
#  Now you know how you can easy to mark important parts in Markdown.
#
#  We suggest to use different notation for italic and bold, for example:
#
#   » Single underscore for _italic_ and double asterisks for **bold**
#   » Single asterisk for *italic* and double underscores for __bold__
#
#  This approach helps to recognize different styles faster. For combined you
#  may mix styles such as _**combined**_ or *__combined__* as well.
