#  Here's the official solution in case you want to compare notes:
#
# # Great!
#
#  There is one more thing. May have any order of numbers in your ordered
#  lists. For example this notations works well:
#
#     0. only zeros
#     0. only zeros
#     0. only zeros
#
#     10. any order
#     5. any order
#     2. any order
#     7. any order
#
#   » only zeros
#   » only zeros
#   » only zeros
#
#   » any order
#   » any order
#   » any order
#   » any order
#
#  Markdown parser is pretty clever to create correct order. This approach
#  may be very useful for supporting big ordered lists.

#  In the next exercise we will take a look at references in Markdown.
